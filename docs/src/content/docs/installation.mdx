## Plugins

SQLsaber supports optional plugins that allows users to extend its capabilities.

There are two official plugins for visualization and Python execution:

```bash
# Visualization plugin - render charts in your terminal
uv tool install --with sqlsaber-viz sqlsaber

# Python sandbox plugin - run Python in a secure sandbox
uv tool install --with sqlsaber-sandbox sqlsaber

# Or install both
uv tool install --with sqlsaber-viz,sqlsaber-sandbox sqlsaber
```

See the [plugins guide](/guides/plugins) for detailed setup and usage.

## Upgrade

```bash
# uv
uv tool upgrade sqlsaber

# pipx
pipx upgrade sqlsaber
```

## Next: Run your first query

```bash
saber
```

On first launch, SQLsaber walks you through database and AI provider setup. See the [getting started guide](/guides/getting-started) for a full walkthrough.
